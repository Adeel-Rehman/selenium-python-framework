# Test Automation Project

This is my first test automation project based on Selenium-Webdriver with Python. It's still developing package of automated tests of phptravels.net demo website.
The collection of tests contains:
- user login tests
- hotels search tests
- flights search tests
- tours search tests
- transfers search tests
In each of the tests the option of loading data from an xlsx file has been implemented.
